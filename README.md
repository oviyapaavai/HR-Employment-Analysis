## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing HR data to gain insights into various aspects of employee management, such as attrition, performance, and compensation. The analysis was conducted using SQL for data querying, Excel for data storage and processing, and Power BI for visualization, aiming to support analytical decision-making in HR operations.

## Project Description
The HR Data Analysis project involves the extraction, processing, and visualization of HR-related data to uncover patterns and trends that can inform HR policies and strategies. SQL queries were executed to manipulate and analyze the dataset, with each query's output converted into Excel files. These Excel files were then imported into Power BI, where interactive reports were created for data exploration.

## Methodology 
  * **Data Ingestion:** The raw HR data was imported into a SQL database for initial processing.
  * **SQL Querying:** Various SQL queries were executed to clean, transform, and analyze the data. Each query's results were exported to individual Excel files, which were used as data sources for further analysis.
  * **Excel Integration:** The Excel files containing the query results were used to structure and store data, making it easier to upload into Power BI for visualization.
  * **Visualization:** The processed data in Excel files was visualized using Power BI, where interactive reports were created to display key insights. The reports include various charts and graphs to represent employee demographics, performance metrics, and attrition rates.
